Land Acknowledgement
We acknowledge the history of this traditional Indigenous territory whose record significantly
precedes that of the European colonial settlers who displaced them centuries ago. We recognize
the significance of this land to its rightful inheritors who survived this displacement and
continue to live here to this day. Whose cultural and spiritual practices have managed to
survive in spite of colonialist attempts to erase them. As such, we would like recognize that
we are convening on unjustly stolen territory that rightfully belongs to the First Nations,
Metis, and Inuit peoples of this continent.

Safer Spaces
If a member feels this policy is being/has been violated, the following steps should be taken:
   1.Reference the policy to the whole group: for example, “In the IWW, we have a ‘Safer Space Policy’
     that all members are mutually responsible to uphold. I feel this policy has been violated
     by talk of ‘[comments made].’ Please keep the Safer Space Policy in mind.”
   2.If the policy is still being violated, the issue should be brought up to the person in violation
     directly and/or the chair,an officer, a delegate, or a member whom you would like to act as an
     advocate on your behalf so that an effective plan of action can be instituted.
   3.If you have no allies locally and invoking the ‘Safer Space Policy’ fails, reach out to the
     Gender Equity Committee for assistanceat GEC@IWW.org.
If a member feels like this policy is being violated and is uncomfortable bringing this up personally,
    they are encouraged to seek an ally of their choosing to advocate for them. In a meeting,
    a person can ask for a point of personal privilege to take a break and
    discuss this with the necessary parties. Meeting chairs, officers, delegates, and members
    should be conscious of this policy and address issues as they arise.
